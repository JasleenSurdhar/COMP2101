$firstnumber plus $secondnumber is $sum
$firstnumber divided by $secondnumber gives $dividend with reminder of $remainder
  - More precisely, it is $fpdividend
$firstnumber multiplied by $secondnumber is $multiply
$firstnumber subtractng by $secondnumber is $sub
Displaying the $firstnumber raised to the power of the $secondnumber is $power
